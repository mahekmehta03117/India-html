            <dt> <b>Biodiversity:</b></dt>
            <dd> <u>Biodiversity is the variety of plant and animal life in the world or in a particular habitat.
                    Biodiversity is measured by two major components: species richness, and species evenness. </u></dd>
        </dl>
        India boasts a rich and diverse biodiversity, harboring a significant portion of the world's flora and fauna. It
        is one of the 17 megadiverse countries, with only 2.4% of the world's land area, yet containing 7-8% of all
        recorded species. This includes over 45,000 plant species and 91,000 animal species. India's unique geographical
        and climatic conditions have resulted in a variety of ecosystems, further contributing to its high
        biodiversity.<br><br>
        India is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries that display high biological diversity and
        contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them. India is the habitat for 8.6% of all
        mammals, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and
        6.0% of all flowering plant species. Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic. India
        also contains four of the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots, or regions that display significant habitat loss
        in the presence of high endemism.<br>
        Biodiversity in India â€“ Flora, and Fauna
        India houses over 500 species of mammals, more than 200 species of birds, and 30,000 different species of
        insects. The Zoological Survey of India which is headquartered in Kolkata is responsible for surveying the
        faunal resources of India.
        India's most dense forests, such as the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the Western Ghats, and
        Northeast India, occupy approximately 3% of its land area. Moderately dense forest, whose canopy
        density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of India's land area. It predominates in the temperate
        coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak
        forest of central and southern India. India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the Deccan
        Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-Gangetic plain,
        now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer visible. Among the Indian
        subcontinent's notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica, or neem, which is widely used in
        rural Indian herbal medicine, and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa, or peepul,[208] which is displayed on the
        ancient seals of Mohenjo-daro, and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought
        enlightenment.
