            <h1><u>Culture Of India</u></h1>
        </font>
    </center>
    <font color="#702963" size="+1">Indian culture is the heritage of social norms and technologies that originated in or
        are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse nation of India, pertaining to the Indian subcontinent
        until 1947 and the Republic
        of
        India post-1947. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly
        connected
        to India by immigration, colonization, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's
        languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food, and customs differ from place to place within the
        country.<br><br>
        Indian culture, often labelled as a combination of several cultures, has been influenced by a history that is
        several millennia old, beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization and other early cultural areas.<br><br>
        Many elements of Indian culture, such as Indian religions, mathematics, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance,
        music, and movies have had a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater India, and the world. The British
        Rule further influenced Indian culture, such as through the widespread introduction of the English language,
        which resulted in a local English dialect and influences on the Indian languages.For generations, India has had
        a prevailing tradition of the joint family system. It is when extended members of a family : parents, children,
        the children's spouses, and their offspring, etc. live together. Usually, the oldest male member is the head
        of the joint Indian family system.

        <h2>Religious Culture</h2>
        Indian-origin religions Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, are all based on the concepts of dharma and
        karma.India has 28 states and 8 union territories with different cultures and is the most populated country in
        the world. The Indian culture, often labeled as an amalgamation of several various cultures, spans across
        the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced and shaped by a history that is several thousand years
        old. Throughout the history of India, Indian culture has been heavily influenced by Dharmic religions.

        <h3>Festivals Of India :</h3><br>
        Indian culture is rich with festivals that are diverse, vibrant, and deeply rooted in religious and regional
        traditions. These festivals, celebrated with great enthusiasm, often involve religious ceremonies, rituals,
        processions, music, dance, and communal feasts. Some of the most prominent include Diwali (Festival of Lights),
        Holi (Festival of Colors), Dussehra, Navratri, and numerous regional harvest festivals like Onam and Baisakhi.
        Several harvest festivals such as Makar Sankranti, Sohrai, PusnÃ¢, Hornbill, Chapchar Kut, Pongal, Onam and Raja
        sankaranti swinging festival are also fairly popular. India celebrates a variety of festivals due to the large
        diversity of India.<br><br>

        <h2> Visual art</h2>
        India has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia,
        especially in the first millennium, when Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and
        Southeast Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.Almost all surviving ancient Indian art
        is in various forms of religious sculpture in durable materials, or coins. There was probably originally far
        more in wood, which is lost. In north India Mauryan art is the first imperial movement. In the
        first millennium CE, Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, East and Southeast Asia, the last
        also greatly influenced by Hindu art.Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from
        Buddhist stupas such as Sanchi, Sarnath and Amaravati, or is rock cut reliefs at sites such as Ajanta,
        Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain sites appear rather later. In spite of this complex mixture of
        religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the
        major religious groups, and sculptors probably usually served all communities.

        <h4> Ancient Paintings</h4>
        Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta Caves
        are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly
        accomplishment in Gupta times. Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India about the 10th
        century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of these was used in
        larger paintings.

        The style spread to Hindu courts, especially among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the
        smaller courts often the most innovative, with figures such as NihÃ¢l Chand and Nainsukh.In the 19th century,
        cheap Kalighat paintings of gods and everyday life, done on paper, were urban folk art from Calcutta, which
        later saw the Bengal School of Art, reflecting the art colleges founded by the British, the first movement in
        modern Indian painting.<br><br>
